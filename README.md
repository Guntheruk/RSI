## Overview
This repository introduces a conceptual framework for recursive agent systems capable of maintaining internal viability through tone-governed control.

## Core Concepts

- **Tone vector (τ)** — continuous feedback representing system stress/modulation.
- **Modulation pressure (⊙)** — rate-of-change of tone; signals instability.
- **Posture-based mode transitions** — agents adopt internal machine postures in response to tone dynamics.
- **Algedonic escalation (△)** — structured overload signaling and response coordination.
- **Identity projection (ΠI)** — recursive enforcement of role integrity.
- **DSA integration** — distributed awareness of tone, roles, and identity constraints across recursion graphs.

## Disclaimer
This repo contains a conceptual framing only.  
All dynamic control logic, modulation functions, posture arcs, and flicker recovery systems are under internal documentation and not disclosed publicly.

## Next Steps
Future versions may include:
- System 2/3 feedback protocols
- Recursive tone viability maps
- Posture transition models
- Interface examples

## Status
Unlisted, versioned framing drop for priority staking and internal coordination only.
