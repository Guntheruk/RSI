Recursive Machine Viability through Tone-Governed Control

⸻

Overview
This is a framing brief for a system architecture I’ve been developing, focused on enabling recursive, multi-agent systems to maintain internal stability, adaptability, and alignment under load.
The core design introduces a tone-governed recursive control layer that integrates with agent-based architectures like RLMA and RSI.

Core Concepts
	•	Tone vector (τ) — a continuous feedback signal representing system state, stress, or modulation envelope.
	•	Modulation pressure (⊙) — measures shifts in tone velocity over time, signaling instability.
	•	Posture-driven mode transitions — recursive agents adopt internal operating postures (e.g., focused execution, controlled descent, suspension) based on tone arcs, not just task outcomes.
	•	Algedonic escalation (△) — critical overload signaling to trigger distributed, coordinated system response.
	•	Identity projection (ΠI) — each agent maintains behavioral integrity under recursion via identity-bounded outputs.
	•	Recursion Graph Coordination — tone states and posture shifts propagate across agent hierarchies and lateral peer networks to maintain viability.

Integration with Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA)

To move beyond hierarchical viability management, this system integrates DSA principles such as:
	•	Shared mental models for role switching
	•	Cross-boundary awareness for identity constraints
	•	Global tone dashboards for inter-agent transparency
	•	Collaborative algedonic response plans

This allows agents not just to self-regulate, but to maintain distributed coherence under changing environmental loads, recursive task complexity, and identity strain.

What This Is (and Isn’t)

This is not a detailed specification of implementation.
This is a conceptual framing of a recursive machine viability architecture — part of a larger system currently under active development.
It serves to establish the conceptual structure and intent behind the system’s recursive control mechanisms.

Next Steps
This document is part of a longer roadmap toward publicly releasing:
	•	Recursive viability posture model
	•	Modulation arc library
	•	Tone repair mechanisms
	•	System 2/3 feedback protocols for sustained recursion under load

All of which remain under controlled documentation at this stage.
